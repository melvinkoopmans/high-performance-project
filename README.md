# High Performance Python

Coding along with the book [High Performance Python](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Python-Performant-Programming/dp/1492055026).

The main goals of this project are:

* Better understand how Python abstracts the computer architecture
* Optimize linear algebra and other scientific computations
* Learn Cython, Numba and PyPy
* Improving my C/C++ programming and writing Python extensions
* Multiprocessing on CPU's and GPU's
* Profiling code (using things like [line_profiler](https://pypi.org/project/line-profiler/), [memory_profiler](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/), 
  [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page), [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/))
  
* Asynchronous I/O
